The following text is adapted from Jenny Bryan's report on English Word lengths from [this activity](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity).

```{r load-hist-dat, include = FALSE}
hist_dat <- read.delim("starting_letters.tsv")
```

On most *nix systems, the file `/usr/share/dict/words` contains a bunch of words. On my machine, it contains `r sum(hist_dat$Freq)` words.

I took count of the starting letter of each word, and tabulated how many words started with a, b, c, etc.

The most frequent starting letter is `r with(hist_dat, Starting_letter[which.max(Freq)])`.

Here is a histogram of starting letters.
