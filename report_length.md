On most \*nix systems, the file `/usr/share/dict/words` contains a bunch
of words. On this machine, it contains 235886 words.

I computed the length of each word, i.e.Â the number of characters, and
tabulated how many words consist of 1 character, 2 characters, etc.

The most frequent word length is 9.

Here is a histogram of word lengths.
